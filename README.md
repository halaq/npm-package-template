# ðŸš€ Welcome to my new awesome project!

This project has been created to show a welcome message by **webpack templete**, you can use this template to generate an NPM package and a vanilla JS library from one source code. You can run the development env and use demo no. 1 (using React JS example) by:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

or run build for the production env and use demo no. 2 (using vanilla JS example):

```
npm install
npm run build
```
